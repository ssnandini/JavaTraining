--Subquery

1) Write a query to find the salary of the employees whose salary is greater than the salary of the employee
whose id is 7566?
select ename,sal from emp where sal>(select sal from emp where empno=7566);

2) Write a query to find the employees who all are earning the highest salary?
select ename,sal from  emp where sal = (select max(sal) from emp);

second highest salary?

Multiple row subquery:

<ANY   => <MAX
> ANY => >MIN
=ANY  => IN
>ALL  =>  >MAX
<ALL  =>  <MIN

1) Write a query to find the employees whose salary is equal to the salary of atleast one employee in depart 30?

2) Write a query to find the employees whose salary is greater than the salary of atleast one employee in depart 30?

-- For each and every excution of the subquery , the outer query will be executed.
-- The sub query is executed for each row of the main query.
